	When using ez.type, use the presets given here:
		https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros/wiki/List-of-Keys

	Created for use with LuaMacros (this was NOT created for AutoHotKey integration), download LuaMacros at this link:
		https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros

	Please watch the tutorial if you need to:
		https://youtu.be/LsHhLZXrQsI

	Features:

		- Access to simple commands as well as being fully-customizable and open source.
		- Fixes the issue of executing a command multiple times by holding the button while still running scripts on KeyDown.
		- Support for multiple keyboards, capacity is untested.
		- Support for multi-key combinations.
		- If you don't know the keycode of a button you're pressing, it will be printed in the output.

	This project was inspired by the King of Macros (Taran Van Hemert) after I watched his LTT video on LuaMacros:
		https://youtu.be/Arn8ExQ2Gjg
	And then, I watched the follow-ups on his personal channel:
		https://youtu.be/y3e_ri-vOIo
		https://youtu.be/Hn18vv--sFY
	In the follow-up videos, he states that he had been encountering issues with LuaMacros as well as the platform he switched to.  I
	have been learning Lua since the summer of 2016, so I figured that I could find out what the issues were.  A couple of hours later,
	I've prepared an in-depth template for anybody to use, complete with user-friendly scripts for the most commonly-used functions.

	It is suggested that you do not edit past this line without intensive knowledge of Lua.
